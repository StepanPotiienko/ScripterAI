## Getting Started

# What is ScripterAI?

You might think that ScripterAI will write you programming scripts, but that is not the main purpose of the project. ScripterAI was originally designed to help with such a headache in every content maker's life, like writing scripts for videos. I've come through this pain and this became motivation for creating the project.

# How to run ScripterAI on your local machine?

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
